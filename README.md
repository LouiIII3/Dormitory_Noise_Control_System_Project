# Dormitory_Noise_Control_System

1. Reason for Creation:
  - There are individuals in the dormitory who make noise until dawn.
  - Provide accurate criteria data regarding noise.
  - Provide information on a systematic management system to identify the source of the noise.
  - Simplify the reporting process to enhance convenience in managing noise within the dormitory.


2. Scenario:

  - When noise occurs in Room 1, the resident of Room 2 reports the complaint to the dormitory supervisor. The dormitory supervisor then verifies the noise in Room 1 and issues a warning to the occupants of that room. This information is communicated back to the resident of Room 1, who reported the noise complaint, for confirmation.
